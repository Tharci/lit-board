# LitBoard

LitBoard is a custom driver for my Anne Pro 2 keyboard firmware fork.

## Features

### Weather Data

The driver is continuously sending weather updates to the keyboard, so that it can display the outside weather as RGB effects. The keyboard can show sunny, cloudy, partially cloudy, snowy, rainy, stormy weather effects, as well as the temperature and current time on command (by lighting up the numbers in order). The rgb effects also take rain, storm, and snow intensity into account.

### Audio Visualizer

When the keyboard switches to the Audio Visualizer effect, the driver starts sending audio strength played on the default output, split into frequency ranges, so that the keyboard can then visualize the audio.
